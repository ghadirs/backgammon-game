# Zero-Test Quality Control

Since we are not using a testing suite, quality must be enforced via the compiler:

1. **Strict Types:** Every prop converted from Figma must have a defined Interface.
2. **Discriminated Unions:** Use them for component states (e.g., `status: 'loading' | 'success' | 'error'`) to prevent impossible UI states.
3. **Zod Validation:** If fetching data, use Zod to validate the schema at runtime. This replaces the need for "integration tests."
