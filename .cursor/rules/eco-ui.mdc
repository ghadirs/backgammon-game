# Sustainable UI Standards

## 🌿 Energy Efficiency
- **CSS over JS:** Use native CSS (Grid/Flexbox) for layouts. Avoid JS-heavy animation libraries for simple transitions.
- **DOM Depth:** Keep the DOM tree shallow. Avoid "div soup" by using semantic HTML (`<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`).
- **Assets:** Always use `loading="lazy"` for images and prioritize SVGs over PNGs.

## 🎨 Figma Translation
- **Design Tokens:** Map Figma hex codes to existing CSS variables (e.g., `var(--primary)`) rather than hardcoding.
- **Responsive:** Build mobile-first. Use Tailwind's `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` prefixes based on Figma breakpoints.
