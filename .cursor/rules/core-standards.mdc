# Core Engineering Standards

## 🧠 Reasoning Protocol

- **Search First:** Always use `grep` or codebase search to find existing patterns before creating new ones.
- **Re-use First:** Do not duplicate logic. If a utility or component exists, extend it.
- **No Assumptions:** If a requirement is vague or a file is missing, ASK. Do not hallucinate.

## 🛠 Coding Quality

- **Clean Code:** Use early returns, descriptive naming (e.g., `isLoading`, `handleAuth`), and functional programming.
- **File Length:** Keep files under 250 lines. Split logic into custom hooks or helper files if they grow.
- **Strict Types:** No `any` types. Interfaces are preferred for data; Types for unions/aliasing.

## 🚫 Prohibited Actions

- **No Testing:** Do not generate unit tests, spec files, or integration tests. I consider frontend tests unnecessary for this project's scope.
- **No Test Dependencies:** Do not suggest installing Jest, Vitest, or Cypress.
